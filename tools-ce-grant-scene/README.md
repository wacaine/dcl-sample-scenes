## Builder Buggyness

Builder is running SDK 6.6.3 (not the latest).  The latest SDK is 6.6.5.  [More on that here](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=72f3d560-d1f4-11eb-9861-ebb8fcfd58d2).

When deployed on the latest SDK it works correctly

#### Known issues:

* Face Player + Face Item using Mode: Scene Axis does not work correctly.  Mode:

## Feature

### Face Player

The target item will rotate towards the player at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player.  The position the item rotates is the position the player was at time of triggering, not where the player moves to afterwards.

### Face Item

The target item will rotate towards the item of interest at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the item.  The position the item rotates is the position the item was at time of triggering, not where the item moves to afterwards.
